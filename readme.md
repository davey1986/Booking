<h1>Simple Booking system, for Bed & Breakfasts, or Hotels </h1>

<p>Created a simple system, for a small B&B who do not want outsiders to see if rooms are available, and want to be easily able to change the rooms price. </p>
<br />
<p align="left">System is mobile, and tablet friendly. So that owners can monitor rooms, while away. </p>
